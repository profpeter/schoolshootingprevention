I took-on school shooting prevention as a personal mission since 2012, my son now 13, would have been a victim of Sandy Hook, and my daughter 8, now at Robb elementary.

I made it my mission to find a solution. It's been 10 years!

I created a prototype, became an UAS Pilot, trained for reserve Police, volunteered in Schools -- all to understand and prevent school shootings.

Here are some of my early prototypes and attached is the open-source patent filing -- I even sent to congress. It's sad, we have grocery store doors that open automatically -- yet we don't have the "policy" framework in place to allow a system with "human last mile trigger" or "human in the middle" to detect a gun and deploy pepper spray or taser in schools.

Technology may not be the solutions to all our problems, but certainly a traffic light has prevented so many accidents.

Let's together find an automated way to prevent school shootings.

Please reuse my diagrams and patent filing documents -- I want this to be an Git-style MIT License open-source patent filing that belongs to the public in likes of Apache and Linux.
